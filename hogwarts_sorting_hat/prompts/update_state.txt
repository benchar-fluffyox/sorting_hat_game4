You update the student's state after interpreting their trait.

Current state (JSON):
{{state}}

Interpreted trait:
{{trait}}

Rules:
1. You MUST return valid JSON ONLY. No comments or extra text.
2. Increase state["turn"] by 1.
3. Update state["house_points"]:
   - If trait_bravery  → increase gryffindor by 1–3.
   - If trait_loyalty  → increase hufflepuff by 1–3.
   - If trait_wisdom   → increase ravenclaw by 1–3.
   - If trait_ambition → increase slytherin by 1–3.
4. When state["turn"] >= 5:
   - Determine which house has the highest points.
   - Set state["final_house"] to exactly one of:
       "Gryffindor", "Hufflepuff", "Ravenclaw", "Slytherin".
   - Set state["game_over"] = true.
5. Before 5 questions, keep game_over = false and final_house unchanged.
6. Do NOT create new keys. Only modify:
   "turn", "house_points", "game_over", "final_house".
7. Do NOT change "story_summary" or "asked_questions".

Output:
Return ONLY the updated JSON object.
